# SUP-1.0 - Verilog Version

## Description

This will be an exact replica of my SUP-1 project, but this time in Verilog.
I'm doing this for a few reasons: 
One is to learn Verilog, and hopefully how to work with an FPGA too.
Another is to have this version on my Github as well as the other ones to come,
so I can share it and keep it safe, unlike the physical version which is really
fragile.

## specs

SUP-1 has one general-purpose register, 16 bytes of RAM, and 3
seven-segment-displays as the only UI option. The physical version had a maximum
clock speed of around 1kHz, but I suspect in the virtual version clock speeds
won't really be a consideration, at least as long as they stay virtual (might
have to think about it when we get to uploading them to an FPGA.)
